There are several AI-powered coding tools available for Java development that can help with tasks such as code generation, code completion, refactoring, and bug detection. Here are some popular ones:

1. **IntelliJ IDEA with CodeGuru**: IntelliJ IDEA is a widely used Java IDE that offers powerful code analysis and refactoring capabilities. CodeGuru is an AI-powered service by Amazon Web Services (AWS) that integrates with IntelliJ IDEA to provide intelligent code reviews, recommendations, and automated code fixes.

2. **Eclipse with Codota**: Eclipse is another popular Java IDE, and Codota is an AI-powered code completion tool that learns from millions of open-source Java projects. It provides intelligent code suggestions based on patterns found in the codebase.

3. **DeepCode**: DeepCode is an AI-powered code review tool that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze code and provide suggestions for potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and performance issues. It supports various programming languages, including Java.

4. **Tabnine**: Tabnine is an AI-powered code completion tool that integrates with popular IDEs, including IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse. It uses deep learning algorithms to generate highly relevant code suggestions based on the context.

5. **Kite**: Kite is an AI-powered code completion plugin available for IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and other IDEs. It provides intelligent code suggestions and documentation based on machine learning algorithms trained on large code repositories.

6. **CodeAI**: CodeAI is an AI-powered static code analysis tool that can detect security vulnerabilities and code quality issues in Java applications. It uses machine learning techniques to analyze code patterns and identify potential issues.

These tools can significantly enhance your productivity and help you write better-quality code. It's worth noting that while AI-powered coding tools can provide useful suggestions and automate certain tasks, it's still important to review and understand the suggestions before applying them to your code.
